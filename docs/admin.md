## Access Control

### User Allowlist

Add individual GitHub users.

**Format:** `@login`

**Example:**

```
@steipete
@jane
@octocat
```

**How to add:**

1. Admin panel → Users and teams
2. Enter `@login`
3. Select role (viewer, maintainer, owner)
4. Click Add

**Role inheritance:**

- User role determined by strongest match
- Direct user entry overrides team membership

### Team Allowlist

Add GitHub teams (all members inherit access).

**Format:** `@org/team`

**Example:**

```
@openclaw/maintainer
@openclaw/core
```

**How to add:**

1. Admin panel → Users and teams
2. Enter `@org/team`
3. Select role
4. Click Add

**Team membership:**

- Fetched from GitHub on each login
- Team membership changes apply immediately (next session)
- Removing team removes access for all members

### Role Hierarchy

```
owner > maintainer > viewer
```

User's effective role = strongest match across:

- Direct user allowlist entry
- All team allowlist entries

**Examples:**

| User     | Allowlist Entries                                        | Effective Role |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| @alice   | `@alice` → maintainer                                    | maintainer     |
| @bob     | `@openclaw/core` → owner                                 | owner          |
| @charlie | `@charlie` → viewer, `@openclaw/maintainer` → maintainer | maintainer     |
| @dave    | (none)                                                   | (blocked)      |

## Repo Allowlist

Only allowlisted repos can be used for cards.

**Format:** `owner/repo`

**Examples:**

```
openclaw/crabyard
openclaw/codex
steipete/PSPDFKit
```

**How to add:**

1. Admin panel → Repos
2. Enter `owner/repo`
3. Click Add

**Effects:**

- Repo appears in card creation dropdown
- Cards can be created for this repo
- Runs can execute against this repo

**How to remove:**

1. Find repo in Repos list
2. Click X button
3. Existing cards preserved
4. New cards blocked until re-added

**Bulk management:**

- No bulk import (yet)
- Add repos one at a time
- Consider scripting via API for large orgs

## Org Policies

### Concurrent Cap

Max number of simultaneous Running cards.

**Default:** 20
**Range:** 1-200

**When cap reached:**

- New cards queue in Todo
- Scheduler claims as capacity frees
- FIFO order (oldest first)

**Planning:**

```
10 users × 2 cards = 20 cap
5 heavy jobs + 15 light = 20 cap
```

**How to set:**

1. Admin panel → Policy
2. Enter new cap (1-200)
3. Click Save policy

**Recommendations:**

- Start with 20
- Monitor "Queue" metric
- Increase if queue consistently >10
- Decrease if costs too high

### Log Retention

Product retention setting for run logs.

**Options:**

- 14 days
- 30 days (default)
- 60 days

**Effects:**

- Current Worker keeps D1 card/run events.
- R2 terminal/artifact lifecycle cleanup is planned for the runtime integration.

**How to set:**

1. Admin panel → Policy
2. Select retention period
3. Click Save policy

**Notes:**

- 30 days is the product default.
- 60 days is reserved for future compliance/audit retention.

### Direct Merge Permission

Configured direct merge policy. The current Worker stores this policy; real merge execution is a planned integration.

**Options:**

**Guarded (default):**

- Intended mode: maintainers can merge if all guardrails pass

**Disabled:**

- No auto-merge intended
- All PRs require manual merge
- Safest option

**Maintainers only:**

- Same as Guarded, explicitly labeled maintainer+

**How to set:**

1. Admin panel → Policy
2. Select direct merge mode
3. Click Save policy

**Recommendations:**

- Start with Disabled for new orgs
- Move to Guarded after testing workflows
- Never merge critical infra repos automatically

## Repo Workflows

Owners can refresh `CRABYARD.md` for enabled repos from Admin → Workflows. For private repos, the Worker needs deployment `GITHUB_TOKEN` access to fetch the file; it does not use the logged-in user's OAuth token for this refresh.

Supported shape:

```yaml
---
runtime:
  default: auto
merge:
  default_policy: open_pr
---
```

What is stored:

- status: `ok`, `missing`, `invalid`, or `error`
- source path and source SHA
- parsed config JSON
- prompt guidance body
- parse/error message

Only runtime and merge defaults in `ok` configs influence card defaults and runtime selection today. `stall_ms`, `cap`, `prompt_prefix`, and the Markdown body are parsed/stored for future policy work. Invalid configs are visible in Admin and ignored.

## Auth

### GitHub OAuth

Recommended for production.

**Setup:**

1. Create GitHub OAuth app in your org
2. Callback URL: `https://crabyard.openclaw.ai/auth/github/callback`
3. Scopes: `read:user`, `read:org`
4. Add secrets to Cloudflare Worker:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` for all enabled repo previews and private repo `CRABYARD.md` refreshes (optional; public/default repo paths work without it)
5. Set `GITHUB_ORG` var (default: `openclaw`)

**Session lifetime:**

- 15 minutes
- Re-login required after expiry

**Benefits:**

- Per-user attribution
- Team membership sync
- No shared tokens

### Bootstrap Token

Admin break-glass access.

**Setup:**

1. Generate strong random token: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Set as `CRABYARD_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` secret in Cloudflare
3. Share securely with initial admin

**Session lifetime:**

- 1 hour (non-refreshing)
- Re-enter token to start new session

**Security:**

- Treat as root password
- Rotate regularly
- Never commit to git
- Use only for initial setup and recovery

**When to use:**

- First-time setup (no users allowlisted yet)
- GitHub OAuth broken
- Emergency access

**Recommended workflow:**

1. Bootstrap admin logs in
   - If GitHub auto-login is active, open `/app?auth=token`.
2. Adds own GitHub user to allowlist as owner
3. Logs out bootstrap
4. Logs in via GitHub OAuth
5. Normal operations use GitHub OAuth only

## Audit Log

All admin actions logged to D1.

**Logged events:**

- User/team allowlist changes
- Repo add/remove
- Policy updates
- Direct merges
- Secret usage (values redacted)
- Takeover events

**Example entries:**

```
2026-05-17 14:32:01 @steipete allowlist updated @jane role=maintainer
2026-05-17 14:35:12 @steipete repo allowlisted openclaw/crabyard
2026-05-17 14:40:00 @steipete policy updated cap=30 retention=30 merge=guarded
2026-05-17 15:10:45 @jane operator takeover granted for CY-101
2026-05-17 15:45:00 @jane merged PR openclaw/crabyard#456 commit=abc123
```

**Retention:**

- Audit log not subject to R2 retention policy
- Kept indefinitely in D1 (until DB size limits)
- Consider periodic export for compliance

**Access:**

- Owner role only
- View in Admin panel → Audit log section (future UI)
- Query D1 directly for now: `SELECT * FROM audit_events ORDER BY created_at DESC`

## Secrets Management

Secrets stored in Cloudflare Worker environment, never in D1/R2.

### Secret Types

**Bootstrap token:**

- `CRABYARD_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`
- Admin break-glass access
- Rotate quarterly

**GitHub OAuth:**

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` for all enabled repo previews and private repo `CRABYARD.md` refreshes
- Rotate if leaked

**GitHub App (future):**

- Private key for repo operations
- Scoped per repo
- Rotate on security events

**Crabbox credentials (future):**

- API token for Crabbox broker
- Scoped to org
- Rotate monthly

### Secret Access

**At runtime:**

- Worker binds secrets from environment
- Never logged
- Never returned in API responses
- Never stored in D1/R2

**Scoped delivery:**

- Containers/Crabbox receive only scoped session tokens
- No broad credentials passed to runtimes
- Session tokens expire after run

### Secret Rotation

**How to rotate:**

1. Generate new secret value
2. Update Cloudflare Worker secret via dashboard or `wrangler secret put`
3. Old sessions fail after expiry (15min-1hr)
4. All new sessions use new secret

**When to rotate:**

- Quarterly (bootstrap token)
- On security incident
- On team member departure
- On credential leak

**Best practices:**

- Store secrets in 1Password/Vault
- Never commit to git
- Never share via Slack/email
- Use `wrangler secret put` (not env vars in code)

## API

### List Allowlist

```bash
GET /api/state
```

Returns full state (owner role only):

```json
{
  "user": {...},
  "allow": [
    {"value": "@steipete", "role": "owner"},
    {"value": "@openclaw/maintainer", "role": "maintainer"}
  ],
  "repos": ["openclaw/crabyard", "openclaw/codex"],
  "cap": 20,
  "retention": "30",
  "merge": "guarded"
}
```

### Add User/Team

```bash
POST /api/admin/allow
{
  "value": "@jane",
  "role": "maintainer"
}
```

Returns updated state.

### Remove User/Team

```bash
DELETE /api/admin/allow/@jane
```

URL-encode value: `DELETE /api/admin/allow/%40jane`

### Add Repo

```bash
POST /api/admin/repos
{
  "repo": "openclaw/crabyard"
}
```

### Remove Repo

```bash
DELETE /api/admin/repos/openclaw%2Fcrabyard
```

URL-encode `owner/repo` → `owner%2Frepo`

### Update Policy

```bash
PUT /api/admin/policy
{
  "cap": 30,
  "retention": "60",
  "merge": "disabled"
}
```

All fields optional. Omitted fields unchanged.

## Monitoring

### Metrics

Dashboard shows:

- **Active:** Running cards count / cap
- **Queue:** Todo cards count
- **Review:** Human Review cards count
- **Logs:** Retention period

**Healthy state:**

- Active < cap (capacity available)
- Queue < 10 (not bottlenecked)
- Review < 20 (not backlogged)

**Warning signs:**

- Active = cap consistently → Increase cap
- Queue > 20 → Increase cap or reduce load
- Review > 50 → Process reviews or adjust merge policy

### Audit Review

Owner should periodically review:

- Recent allowlist changes (who added what)
- Direct merges (which PRs auto-merged)
- Takeover events (who took control of which runs)
- Policy changes (who changed caps/retention/merge)

**How to review:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE created_at > strftime('%s', 'now', '-7 days') * 1000
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Query D1 directly via `wrangler d1 execute`.

## Best Practices

### Allowlist Management

**Start small:**

- Add owners first
- Add core team as maintainers
- Add observers as viewers
- Expand gradually

**Use teams:**

- Prefer `@org/team` over individual users
- Easier to manage at scale
- Automatic sync with GitHub membership

**Review regularly:**

- Quarterly audit of allowlist
- Remove departed team members
- Downgrade inactive members to viewer

### Repo Management

**Allowlist only active repos:**

- Don't allowlist entire org
- Add repos as needed
- Remove deprecated/archived repos

**Avoid wildcards:**

- No `*` support (yet)
- Explicit per-repo approval required
- Prevents accidental access to sensitive repos

### Policy Tuning

**Concurrent cap:**

- Start with 20
- Monitor queue length
- Increase if bottlenecked
- Decrease if costs too high

**Log retention:**

- 30 days sufficient for most
- Increase to 60 for compliance
- Export logs to external storage for long-term retention

**Direct merge:**

- Start disabled
- Enable guarded after workflow proven
- Never auto-merge critical infrastructure

### Security

**Bootstrap token:**

- Rotate quarterly
- Store in 1Password/Vault
- Use only for break-glass access

**GitHub OAuth:**

- Use org-owned OAuth app (not personal)
- Scope to `read:user read:org repo`
- Rotate client secret on security events

**Secrets:**

- Never log or expose
- Use Cloudflare secrets (not env vars)
- Audit secret usage via audit log

**Audit log:**

- Review weekly (owner)
- Export for compliance
- Alert on suspicious patterns

## Troubleshooting

### User can't log in via GitHub

**Cause:** Not in OpenClaw org or not allowlisted

**Solution:**

1. Verify user is in GitHub org
2. Check allowlist for `@login` or `@org/team` entry
3. Add if missing

### Team allowlist not working

**Cause:** GitHub team membership not synced

**Solution:**

- Team membership fetched fresh on each login
- User must log out and back in to refresh teams
- Verify team slug matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Repo not appearing in dropdown

**Cause:** Repo not allowlisted

**Solution:**

1. Admin → Repos
2. Add `owner/repo`
3. Refresh page

### Direct merge blocked

**Cause:** Policy disabled or guardrails failed

**Solution:**

1. Check Admin → Policy → Direct merge setting
2. Verify CI checks all green
3. Verify branch up to date
4. Check no active takeover
5. User has maintainer+ role
