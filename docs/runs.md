# Runs

A run is a durable attempt to execute a card. Today Crabfleet records attempts, heartbeats, runtime selection evidence, operator intent, and event logs in D1. Interactive Crabboxes can attach to live PTYs through the Worker terminal hub and expose WebVNC when the Crabbox adapter returns a URL.

## Run Lifecycle

Current statuses:

```text
queued -> leasing -> running -> review | completed | failed | stalled | canceled
```

The MVP creates a `queued` run attempt when a card is claimed and pulses it to `running` on activity. Moving the card to Human Review or Done finishes the active run as `review` or `completed`; moving away from a running card cancels it.

## Claiming

When a maintainer starts or advances a card into Running, the Worker:

1. Reconciles stale active runs.
2. Verifies the repo allowlist.
3. Checks the configured concurrent cap, default `20`.
4. Refreshes cached repo workflow config if needed.
5. Selects runtime descriptor.
6. Inserts a `run_attempts` row.
7. Records scheduler and runtime evidence events.

If the cap is reached, the card stays queued and receives a capacity event.

## Runtime Selection

Selection order:

1. Explicit card runtime `container` or `crabbox`.
2. Prompt cues `vnc`, `manual`, `takeover`, `gpu`, `perf`, or `performance` route to Crabbox.
3. Valid repo `CRABBOX.md` runtime default.
4. Default Container runtime.

Each selected runtime stores:

- `selectionReason`
- `capabilities.terminal`
- `capabilities.takeover`
- `capabilities.vnc`
- `capabilities.desktop`
- `capabilities.logs`
- `capabilities.artifacts`

The UI labels sessions from capabilities, and the API rejects takeover unless the active run advertises takeover.

## Repo Workflow Defaults

Owners can evaluate `CRABBOX.md` in Admin.

```yaml
---
runtime:
  default: auto
merge:
  default_policy: open_pr
---
```

Supported runtime values are `auto`, `container`, and `crabbox`. Supported merge policies are `open_pr`, `merge_when_green`, and `fix_until_green_and_merge`. `stall_ms`, `cap`, `prompt_prefix`, and the Markdown body are parsed/stored for future policy work, but only runtime and merge defaults are effective today. Invalid files are visible in Admin and ignored for defaults.

## Heartbeats and Stalls

Active statuses are `queued`, `leasing`, and `running`. A run stalls when its heartbeat is older than the configured threshold, default 5 minutes. Reconciliation marks the run `stalled`, sets `endedAt`, stores `heartbeat timeout`, moves the card to Human Review, and logs the event.

Manual `stall` marks the card Human Review and preserves the active run record with the supplied reason.

## Terminal Grid

Attach opens a fullscreen Ghostty WASM grid. Current behavior:

- Shows one or more Codex session tiles.
- Includes standalone interactive Codex CLI sessions created from New session.
- Uses the local `ghostty-web` bundle served by the Worker.
- Streams live PTY bytes through the multiplex `/api/terminal/ws` hub when a sandbox or bridge is configured.
- Replays D1 event logs into the terminal surface while a live PTY is unavailable.
- Falls back to a text terminal if Ghostty cannot initialize.
- Copies terminal selection, pastes clipboard text when the viewer has writable control, and uploads clipboard images/files for Cloudflare Sandbox sessions.
- Persists local grid layout preferences: auto or 1-10 columns, compact mode, drag reorder, and per-tile width/height sizing.
- Supports focused fullscreen card view.
- Supports focused share URLs with public read-only event scrollback and owner-approved writable control requests for signed-in viewers.

The Take over action records `controlIntent = "takeover"` and operator only for active runs with takeover capability.

## Interactive CLI Sessions

Maintainers can create a standalone Codex CLI session without making a board card. The Worker stores the requested repo, branch, runtime, command, owner, attach/VNC URLs, status, and event log in D1. The default runtime is `container` so production opens a Worker-owned Cloudflare Sandbox Codex terminal without requiring a separate crabbox adapter.

Session events are mirrored into the `SESSION_LOGS` R2 binding when configured. Crabfleet writes NDJSON, Markdown transcript, and summary objects under `orgs/openclaw/interactive-sessions/<id>/`, while D1 keeps the compact event list and archive keys for the app, CLI, and SSH gateway.

If `CRABBOX_INTERACTIVE_PROVISION_URL` is not set, new sessions stay `pending_adapter` and remain visible in the Ghostty grid. If it is set, Crabfleet posts the session request to that endpoint with optional bearer auth from `CRABBOX_INTERACTIVE_PROVISION_TOKEN`; the response can set `status`, `leaseId`, `attachUrl`, `vncUrl`, and `message`.

Crabfleet also ships a built-in provision hook at `/api/provision/interactive`. Point `CRABBOX_INTERACTIVE_PROVISION_URL` at that route to use Worker-side backend selection. Set `CRABBOX_INTERACTIVE_PROVISION_TOKEN` for backend-enabled deployments; the route fails closed without it when a backend is configured. The route delegates to `CRABBOX_RUNTIME_PROVISION_URL` when set, creates a Cloudflare Container sandbox for `container` sessions through `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_URL` when configured, or creates a ClawFleet OpenClaw instance for `crabbox` sessions through `CRABBOX_CLAWFLEET_URL`; without a matching backend it returns `pending_adapter` with a clear setup message.

Cloudflare runner configuration:

- `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_URL`: Crabbox Cloudflare container runner base URL.
- `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_TOKEN`: runner bearer token.
- `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_INSTANCE_TYPE`: `lite`, `basic`, `standard-1`, `standard-2`, `standard-3`, or `standard-4`; default `standard-4`.
- `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_WORKDIR`: base workspace path; default `/workspace/crabbox`.
- `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_TTL_SECONDS`: default `14400`.
- `CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_RUNNER_IDLE_SECONDS`: default `1800`.
- `CRABBOX_PTY_BRIDGE_URL`: optional explicit PTY bridge WebSocket URL/template. Templates support `{id}`, `{leaseId}`, `{repo}`, `{branch}`, and `{runtime}`.
- `CRABBOX_PTY_BRIDGE_TOKEN`: optional bearer token sent only from Crabfleet to the bridge.

Runner PTY contract:

- Crabfleet accepts the browser WebSocket on `/api/terminal/ws` and multiplexes one or more subscribed sessions.
- Crabfleet connects upstream to the configured bridge with `Upgrade: websocket`.
- Browser-to-Crabfleet messages use binary terminal frames for subscribe, input, resize, and stop.
- Runner-to-browser output is wrapped in terminal output frames with session IDs.
- The bridge receives `x-crabbox-session`, `x-crabbox-repo`, and `x-crabbox-runtime` headers plus session query parameters.

Session sharing:

- `Share` creates a public read-only URL at `/app/sessions/:id?token=...`.
- The share token is stored as a hash; generating a new link rotates the old one.
- Public viewers can scroll the persisted session event buffer without signing in.
- Writable PTY access still requires a signed-in allowlisted viewer and owner/maintainer approval.

## Run APIs

Start or pulse:

```bash
POST /api/cards/:id/actions
{"action":"start"}
```

Attach:

```bash
POST /api/cards/:id/actions
{"action":"attach"}
```

Take over:

```bash
POST /api/cards/:id/actions
{"action":"takeover"}
```

Requires maintainer role, active run, and `capabilities.takeover = true`.

History:

```bash
GET /api/cards/:id/runs
```

Returns all attempts for the card, newest first.

## Test Stack

- `pnpm run check`: asset generation, `tsgo --noEmit`, `oxlint`, `oxfmt --check`.
- SQLite migration smoke with migrations applied in order.
- `codex-review` per feature until no accepted/actionable findings remain.
- Browser/live smoke after deploy for `/app`, `/docs/`, auth surface, and docs subdomain.
